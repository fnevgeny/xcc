XCC - XML Compiler-Compiler

Copyright (c) 2000-2023 Evgeny Stambulchik

XCC is a tool for building XML format parsers. One way to describe what XCC
does is by analogy with a generic parser generator, e.g. yacc or bison. Yacc
needs a lexical analyzer to function properly, and that lexical analyzer is
usually built with (f)lex. In the XML world, there are a few packages which
fill in the role of lex (expat and libxml are the most known), but the
high-level grammar parsing is usually done by a hand-written code; writing
such a parser is a tedious and error-prone task.

XCC was created to help developers in writing reliable easy-to-understood
parsers for handling complex XML-based grammars.

The grammar is described in an XML dialect as well; it resembles the XML Schema
with some notations inspired by yacc.

Since version 0.0.1, XCC has been self-hosting. Therefore, given the present
lack of documentation, its sources may be used to learn the grammar. However,
if the recursive nature of it causes you light dizziness (it does for me ;-)),
you're advised to explore the "examples" dir instead.

To create packages for your OS, check the "packaging" directory.
