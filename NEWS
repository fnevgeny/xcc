New with 0.4.0, released 2005-07-26:

    * xcc_parse() is now dynamically generated, and may be optionally
      prefixed, thus allowing for multiple parsers per application.
    * Implemented exception handling via (optional) user-supplied
      function.
    * [BB] Fixed segfault when no element-type definition existed
      for an element.
    * [BB] Don't declare an empty XCCAType if there are no
      attributes.
    * [BB] Add the element name to the case labels in end_handler().


New with 0.3.4, released 2005-07-04:

    * Added exception notice to the public XCC stuff, permitting
      its use beyond the GPL terms.
    * Detect whether a given element has all parents of the same C
      type, and if yes, cast $P replacement automatically.


New with 0.3.3, released 2005-03-13:

    * First public release.
