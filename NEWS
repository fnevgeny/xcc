    * [BB] Added packaging configurations/scripts for Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD, and Solaris.
    * [BB] Added man page.
    * Output preamble prior to including the standard xcc headers, thus giving

    * Extended version info output.
    * Fixed off-by-one #line numbering of the output file.

      of elements contains a cdata section.


New with 0.5.2, released 2005-12-10:

    * Implemented defining default values of optional attributes, like in W3C
      schemas.
    * A couple of minor memory leaks fixed.
    * More checks added, eliminating possible crashes on inconsistently defined
      xcc inputs.
    * "unbounded" value for the "maxOccurs" attribute is now properly parsed.


New with 0.5.1, released 2005-10-20:

    * [BB] Added #line directives to the generated source. Can be disabled
      with the "-l" switch.
    * [BB] Honour DESTDIR during installation.
    * [BB] Fixed possible buffer overflows.
    * [BB] Fixed code generation when the input doesn't use attributes.
    * [BB] A memory leak fixed.

    * Implemented defining and run-time checking of cardinality of elements
      and attributes.

    * Fixed potential buffer overflow.
    * Miscellaneous fixes.


New with 0.4.0, released 2005-07-26:

    * xcc_parse() is now dynamically generated, and may be optionally
      prefixed, thus allowing for multiple parsers per application.
    * Implemented exception handling via (optional) user-supplied
      function.
    * [BB] Fixed segfault when no element-type definition existed
      for an element.
    * [BB] Don't declare an empty XCCAType if there are no
      attributes.
    * [BB] Added element name to the case labels in end_handler().


New with 0.3.4, released 2005-07-04:

    * Added exception notice to the public XCC stuff, permitting
      its use beyond the GPL terms.
    * Detect whether a given element has all parents of the same C
      type, and if yes, cast $P replacement automatically.


New with 0.3.3, released 2005-03-13:

    * First public release.
